In the documents folder, you will find the team contract, concept document, production plan, the GDD, the ASG (art bible), and the menu wireframes.

In the build folder, you will find the Unity project folder as well as the final working game. Under the GameBuild folder, the game is called "New Unity Project" as it wasn't renammed on accident. 

How to play the game:
The player will load in at the beginning and in order to move around, you can utilize the WASD keys and even the spacebar to jump. The player must dodge the enemy (knight) by utilizing the keyboard keys to move around him. You must get to the final room that's past the knight to reach the chest. All the player has to do is touch the chest and the player (you), wins the level.

Other: 
The coder tested out all possible scenes in regards to getting caught and to winning and worked perfectly. Through building and finalization all scenes and all code works, but the mouse gets stuck or starts to shake at the end. Might be a bug on the groups end or an issue with the computer. Works for one person and not the other.

You can find the actual Unity editor scene by going into the assets folder and scolling down to Scenes and clicking "SampleScene" to open it in editor.
